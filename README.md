# Databases
Databases assignments

The following projects built over the semester. The assignments are focused on relations within a table (abstract) of
a database.
-The first project begins by using binary values to create all possible subsets of a string (aka relation)
-The second project is used to determine the candidate key(s) from a list of all superkeys
-The third project distinguishes super keys of a relation based on given functional dependencies

All projects (.java files) are thoroughly commented to further list 'purpose of project' and process of the program.
